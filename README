Cura is a mobile phone application for the Android platform (Gingerbread 2.3.3 and above). It is a bundle of remote systems administration tools targeted mainly at sysadmins.

When in the hands of a sysadmin, Cura will provide:

**A personalized Terminal emulator for direct interaction with said server.

**The Syslog module that allows for reading logs directly from the server.

**The SysMonitor module that visually graphs CPU and RAM usage percentages.

**Access to the port-scanning utility “Nmap”. (not until 2.0)

**Server Stats are general server information like its Vitals, Mounted Filesystems, Memory information, processes and so on.

**Added to which, a security feature will be implemented that allows users to have Cura's database completely wiped upon them sending the compromised phone a secret pattern of their choosing. (ex: send an SMS message containing "phone has been stolen!" to your Android phone to wipe Cura's database and receive the location of the compromised phone as an SMS to your emergency phone number or as an e-mail to your emergency e-mail address).

Cura is multi-lingual and for now, it supports English, Arabic, German and Greek.
